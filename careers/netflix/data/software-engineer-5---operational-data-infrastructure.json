                "description": "Content Infrastructure & Solutions (CIS) empowers engineers working on content and studio applications to be innovative and agile in supporting our massive global content production needs. Infrastructure pieces like very large-scale media processing platforms (1, 2), workflows (conductor), media asset management, collaboration, reporting, data movement and data processing are some of the key services we build. All this is custom-built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. 

The Operational Data Infrastructure (ODI) is a part of the CIS organization–which provides infrastructure services that simplify discovering and accessing data produced across the Studio & Content applications, catering to both technical and non-technical end-users, and making operational reporting easier and more efficient. Currently, the core service to enable a highly leverageable reporting infrastructure is in a proof of concept phase. This presents a great opportunity to be a part of building and shaping such novel and high-impact foundational services at Netflix. The ODI team also owns other mature applications which serve specific reporting needs and their usage help inform the design and implementation of new services. 

About the role
We are looking for a Backend Software Engineer 5 to help shape and build next-generation reporting infrastructure services and tools. In this role, you will have the opportunity to drive technical strategy and direction, own development end-to-end, manage stakeholder relationships, provide actionable feedback and insights to colleagues, and create technical solutions at scale. We are looking for a problem-solver who delivers well-tested, maintainable, performant, and predictable implementations.
