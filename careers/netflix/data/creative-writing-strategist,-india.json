                "description": "Netflix is building the world’s leading entertainment platform, offering great films and series that push the boundaries of storytelling and delight members of all ages and tastes across the world. Our team, Creative Writing Strategy, shapes the words that guide members to the content that is right for them. 

We are seeking a seasoned writing strategist to join our team. The ideal candidate is a skilled writer and editor who is an expert on Indian content — you should have a strong love for Bollywood and Tollywood. We are particularly interested in writers who have proven multilingual proficiency in writing and editing world-class creative content. 

Responsibilities 
You'll be expected to write and oversee clear, engaging, accurate copy in English and at least one major Indian language. In addition to executing writing tasks yourself, you'll work with a talented team of entertainment writers, editors, and colleagues across the globe to build context around titles and help connect users to the content they love.

You’ll apply your writing expertise and passion to cross-functional innovation projects, collaborating with other writing, analysis, localization, design and product teams. Since we are part of a distributed team, you’ll use Slack, Google Workspace, email and other digital tools to communicate about assignments, projects and publishing deadlines. 

You’ll work with a Managing Editor to ensure that projects are adequately resourced with the right writers, and you’ll ensure that external resources (vendors) have access to relevant information and provide editorial guidance for high-priority titles. You’ll also collaborate closely with other stakeholders to gather insight on Netflix original language content and support the writing efforts to bring this content to a global audience.
