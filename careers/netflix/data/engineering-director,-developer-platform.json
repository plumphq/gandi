                "description": "It’s an amazing time to be joining Netflix as we continue to transform entertainment. We deliver billions of hours of movies and TV shows per month to more than 230 million members in over 190 countries. At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world. Our Developer Platform enables Netflix engineering teams to rapidly build and create innovative experiences for our members and creators all around the globe.

At Netflix, we empower developers to take ownership and handle their creations throughout the entire software development lifecycle. We scale this approach through substantial investments in developer tooling, streamlining, and automating DevOps to minimize repetitive tasks.

Within the Platform Engineering organization, Developer Platform's mission is to optimize the impact of Netflix engineering teams throughout the entire software development lifecycle. We invest deeply in developer tooling, supporting their needs from project start to production operations. We offer comprehensive experiences for software development, delivery, operations, and maintenance. By providing reliable, high-performing, secure, and flexible developer tools, services, and infrastructure, we ensure Netflix can scale and adapt swiftly to meet business demands.

We free Netflix engineers from the complexity of modern software development, allowing them to focus on creating world-class entertainment.

The Opportunity

We are looking for an Engineering Director to drive the next evolution of our Developer Platform with best-in-class experiences that simplify and accelerate workflows that empower and delight software engineers. We strive to manage more for developers so they can innovate more for Netflix. This role encompasses the following domains:

Frontend Application Development (JavaScript/Node.js)
Provide a world-class development experience for Frontend developers at Netflix by supporting the software development lifecycle for JavaScript libraries and Services.

Backend Application Development (JVM Languages)
Keep developers in the flow during application development by optimizing the inner development loop for our JVM ecosystem. Look holistically at the end-to-end experience through the entire lifecycle, from project initialization to ongoing operations and maintenance for backend application developers.

Machine Learning & Data Science Ecosystems (Python)
Provide a paved road for Python development as it is one of the three primary languages in use at Netflix and is fundamental to many critical business scenarios (machine learning, personalization, data science, experimentation, content-encoding, and more).
