                "description": "We’re looking for a creative and highly-skilled Lead Tech Artist to help us forge the creative vision on a brand-new AAA multi-platform game. This is a unique opportunity to be at the heart of crafting and bringing to life worlds for one of Netflix’s first generation of internally developed original games.

As Lead Tech Artist, you will help define the overall quality and bridge tech and art, while managing, mentoring and caring for the well-being of your team members. The ideal candidate is a well organized leader with a strong, hands-on background with a devotion for sharing. This role will involve leading all aspects of production by collaborating with Character Artists, Environment Artists, and Animators to deliver the highest quality for the game.

We're building the foundation for a small, but ambitious, team of creators whose primary goal is to create a game experience that our players want to repeatedly come back to; and as our Lead Tech Artist, you will be able to create, ship, and run a game without any competing design constraints due to monetization.

Quality is something that we are immensely proud to be aiming for, and we are looking at putting the right team together to help take us forward. We’re looking for that group of leaders who are aligned with our core values, and care deeply about the experiences they create as well as the people they make them with. Those who have bias towards action and are energized by the learning that comes with bold experimentation at an agile pace. As a part of Netflix, we strive to hire the best and value integrity, excellence, respect, inclusion, and collaboration. 

Now is an amazing time to join Netflix as we seek to entertain the world. We have over 200 million paid members in over 190 countries, and we won’t stop there!
