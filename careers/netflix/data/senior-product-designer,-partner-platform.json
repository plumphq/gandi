At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world and are constantly innovating on how entertainment is imagined, created, and delivered to a global audience. We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 240 million paid members.

We’re looking for a highly ambitious, energetic, and experienced lead-level Product Designer who will enable a best-in-class Netflix platform experience for our global partnerships. You will lead design for a pillar of Netflix’s Partner Enablement Platform XD team, and be a strategic partner to our stunning product, engineering, and business colleagues to build the apps, tools, and services that scale Netflix’s global presence through partnerships. 

This will be a remote-friendly role with the freedom to set your own work-from-home schedule.  There will be times where the team will meet onsite in Los Gatos/Los Angeles for meaningful moments of collaboration and bonding. We want you to be happy and have a work-life-balance that enables you to thrive!


More About Our Team
Our team designs the enterprise ecosystem that scales Netflix entertainment through our global partnerships with telecoms, device manufacturers, game studios, advertisers, and data centers.  We also design the foundational capabilities and technology for the next-generation of Netflix experiences, like games. Our team’s primary superpower is the ability to design creatively and collaboratively in highly technical environments – from core services that power Netflix messaging to industry-leading partnership platforms. You’ll be one of the lead designers who crafts the apps, tools, and services that enable these experiences and partnerships.  More specifically, you’ll be a critical part of one of the most talented and trailblazing enterprise design teams in the world.

Scaling to connect Netflix with 240+ million people in 190 countries with movies, TV series, games, and interactive experiences requires strategic partnerships and high-quality product integrations. Ever wonder about the Netflix button on new TV remotes or how the Netflix app is always ready when you boot up your new device? Or how Netflix is now an option that can be added to your cable bundle? 

Netflix works closely with a variety of partners such as Google, Samsung, Amazon, and regional partners like Comcast and Sky to integrate and launch Netflix applications on their devices. You’ll be the lead designer who crafts the apps, tools, and services that enable these experiences and partnerships.  You’ll play a critical role in delivering the joy of Netflix to the world!
