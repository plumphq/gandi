                "description": "THE CHALLENGE
Eventbrite's business continues to grow and scale rapidly, powering millions of events. Event creators and event goers need reliable tools and technologies that empower their live experiences. In turn, Eventbrite’s development teams need effective tools and techniques for testing and delivering high quality products. Software Developers in Test (SDET) are Eventbrite’s center of excellence for software quality and are responsible for leading the adoption and implementation of world class automated testing solutions. You will work both within a centralized test automation-focused team, and as support to other development teams as they implement testing frameworks and expand test coverage. 

THE TEAM
The members of our team tackle big problems through small group collaboration. Our technology spans web, mobile, APIs, big data and machine learning, search, as well as physical point of sale and ticket scanning systems. As a people-focused organization, we support a culture of inclusion, mentorship, and continuous learning. Pair programming, weekly demos, tech talks, and hackathons are at the core of how we build our team and product. We’re currently working through a transition to a pure Devops culture. We strive for teams to be completely autonomous and to have full ownership of their services and roadmaps. This includes requirements gathering,  deployment, maintenance - and testing!

THE ROLE
We seek Senior Software Engineers with passion for quality and automated testing to join the team. Our mission is to enable the delivery of highest-quality products by making writing and maintaining tests easy. To make this happen, typical activities include:

-Build self-service test automation frameworks that are reliable, reusable, easy to maintain and extend across multiple locales, devices, features, teams, etc. 
-Focus on eliminating manual/regression test execution and improve test efficiency by creating automated solutions
-Enable automated test executions within CI/CD pipelines. 
-Support development teams in monitoring, maintaining, refactoring, and continuously improving existing automated tests.
-Develop tools and processes for managing test environments.Develop tools and processes for creating and managing test data.
-Collaborate with development teams to architect robust test infrastructure that enable them to conduct efficient automated testing across the testing pyramid.
-Perform gap analysis and continuously refine the test framework to enable earlier defect detection in the development lifecycle. 
-Review reported bugs and incidents postmortems to identify test infrastructure gaps which prevented the detection of the issues.
