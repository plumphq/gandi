THE TEAM
We work on foundational aspects key to making our Development teams successful. We are responsible for the efficiency of the software development lifecycle for our applications. This includes proposing and building new application architecture and building tooling to create a more pleasant developer experience while at the same time keeping our core systems up to date.
